            <h1>Some clarification regarding GDPR</h1>
            <p>StepUp doesn't collect connection data or unique identifiers
                other than the one provided by your client (usually, a Pebble
                app.)</p>
            <p>If you enter personally identifiable information as a username
                in StepUp, that means you consent to StepUp's displaying of that
                data to other users. If you'd like to revoke your consent,
                please change you username to something that doesn't identify
                you.</p>
            <p>If you'd like your data to be deleted, please:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>add "delete" to your username to verify that you
                    actually own the account</li>
                <li>email step[&#x0061;t]null.ist.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If you're unable to prove ownership of an account (for example,
                because your client data is lost) your account will be deleted
                upon your request if it has been inactive for 28 days.</p>
            <p>Please keep in mind that there isn't really any benefit to
                account deletion. We simply don't share personally identifying
                information without your explicit permission (such as adding a
                friend or setting your profile to public)</p>
            <hr/>
            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <h2>Your Data</h2>
            <h3>Data that StepUp collects</h3>
            <ul><li>Step information &amp; its associated date of collection<br/>
             (data for up to the last 28 days may be stored)</li>
            <li>data you explicitly provide (such as your username)</li></ul>
            <h3>Data usage</h3>
            <p>Data is used to provide the service. Anonymized
            data may be used for research purposes or provided to the public.
            Personal data will never be sold or given to third parties except
            with explicit permission from the user.</p>
            <p>User data may be relinquished when required for compliance
            with US laws.</p>
            <h3>Data visibility</h3>
            <p>StepUp differentiates between two kinds of user data:</p>
            <ul><li>Profile Information
             <ul><li>Visible by anyone</li>
             <li>This includes:
                 <ul><li>Your username</li>
                 <li>Your following/follower counts
                     [but not their identities]</li>
                 <li>Whether your profile is set to public</li>
            </ul></li></ul></li>
            <li>Activity Data<br/>
             Only visible by other users if you <strong>follow
                 them</strong> and/or <strong>your profile is set to
                 public</strong></li></ul>
            <h3>Public profiles</h3>
            <p>StepUp allows you to set your profile to "public". You can
            change this setting at any time.</p>
            <p>If your profile is set to public:</p>
            <ul><li>Anyone will be able to access your step data</li>
            <li>Your profile may be listed in a global leaderboard</li></ul>
            <h3>Third-party apps: For users</h3>
            <p>StepUp may offer credentials usable to share
            information with third-party apps (such as watchfaces that display
            the progress of users you follow.) If a user with access to your
            step data configures such access to their account, your activity
            history may be visible to them.</p>
            <h3>Third-party apps: For developers</h3>
            <p>By developing, publishing, or otherwise making
            available an app using the StepUp API, you agree not to transfer the
            user data received from the StepUp API to any devices except the
            client device which the app is installed upon. "Client device"
            refers to the device possessed by a StepUp user, and requests to the
            API must be made from such devices directly (or through
            user-configured proxies); not through an intermediary server.</p>
            <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
            <h3>Profanity and Harassment</h3>
            <p>Profanity or harassment of other users is not tolerated and
            may result in your account being permanently banned.</p>
            <h3>Account deletion and data retrieval</h3>
            <p>Please contact the developer via the Pebble App Store page to
            delete your account or to retrieve a copy of all your user data.</p>
            <p>StepUp cannot be held responsible for loss of user data.</p>
            <h3>Changes</h3>
            <p>Changes to the Privacy Policy or Terms of Service will be
            visible on https://step-up-health.github.io/ at least 14 days
            before the time they take effect.</p>
